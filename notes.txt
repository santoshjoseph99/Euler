sum of all positive numbers which CANNOT be written as the sum of 2 abundant numbers

abundant number: sum of diviors is greater then number

28123 - every number above this can be written as a sum of 2 abundant numbers
24 - smallest number which can be written as a sum of 2 abundant numbers

25 -> find all abundant number below this (1..24), then add them in all permutations

algorithm:
    find all abundant number -> [a]
    find sums of all pairs of abundant numbers in [a] -> [b]
    sum all numbers not in [b] -> c
